okay let me update you on the progress ive made, ill show all the current files i have in my workspace below to give you the full picture and allow you to make suggestions on where to go next, i will also attach the project requirements document we wrote to remind you of where the project is headed. my next goal is to test a few camera settings and make sure that adjusting the values in firestore actually results in the settings being applied. The easiest way to do this, which will double as a sanity check would be to create an isolated test script which just tests the effects of changing different camera settings on pictures/ videos, as well as testing changing settings in real time during a live feed if this is a possibility. Then i will have confidence that these settings will work in situ. After testing settings i may be happy with the state of phase 2 and will want to move on to phase 3 and start developing a front end. Please guide me on where to go next and if there are any issues with the current workspace. 



The current architecture is as follows:



Birdfeeder

->PythonScripts(camera_server.py, config.py, config_updater.py, data_logger.py, MotionCam.py, requirements.txt, storage_cleanup, stream_listener)

->upload_queue

-> birdfeeder-sa.json

->local_app_settings.json

->log_data.log
