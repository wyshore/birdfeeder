okay we have an issue with the catalogging, i selected 6 photos and grouped them as a species, it removed them from the activity screen and created a new catalog entry. So far so good, except heres the issue, the bird profile still does not show the bird photos for that species and there are no histograms either. I think this is because when the bird photos were moved from the activity screen they were not referenced or placed in a useable location? Please have a look and try to sort this out. I think we are currently missing the data for each sighting in a catalog entry and that is why there are no images or data showing up. Currently i dont know where the 6 photos of that bird have moved to and would like to find them. 

This catalogging system should work as follows:

- The birds are identified from the activity screen and sorted into a catalog entery for their respective species
- If a bird is mistakenly identified to the wrong species the user should be able to reidentify it which will move it to a different catalog entry, or unidentify it, which will move it back to the activity screen. 

Also currently the header photo for the bird profile screen is obnoxiously huge, shrink it down to a reasonable size.
