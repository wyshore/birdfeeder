# Phase 6: UI Polish & Aesthetics

**Goal:** Improve visual design and user experience.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Color Scheme & Theming
- Review current deepPurple/amber scheme
- Consider nature-inspired palette (greens, blues, earth tones)
- Implement light/dark mode toggle
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

### 2. Icons & Visual Hierarchy
- Replace generic Material icons with custom or themed icon set
- Improve icon consistency
- Better visual separation between sections
- Card elevation and shadows for depth

### 3. Animations & Transitions
- Page transition animations
- Loading state animations (shimmer effects)
- Smooth scroll behaviors
- Micro-interactions (button presses, deletions)

### 4. Loading States & Error Handling
- Skeleton loaders while data loads
- Empty state designs (no sightings yet, etc.)
- Friendly error messages with retry actions
- Network offline indicator

### 5. Responsive Layout
- Test on different desktop window sizes
- Adaptive grid columns based on width
- Proper text scaling
- Touch-friendly targets (even on desktop)

### 6. Data Visualization
- Better chart aesthetics in stats_screen
- Color coding for battery levels
- Interactive tooltips on hover
- Smooth chart animations

## Implementation Approach
**Defer details until Phases 1-5 complete.** At that point:
1. Create design mockups or wireframes
2. Implement component by component
3. User testing for feedback
4. Iterate on aesthetics

## Success Criteria
✓ Cohesive visual design
✓ Smooth, responsive interactions
✓ Clear error states and loading indicators
✓ Improved user satisfaction
